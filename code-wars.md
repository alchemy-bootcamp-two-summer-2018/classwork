# Bootcamp II ... Code Wars!

Part of growing as a programmer is to practice, practice, practice. Throughout this course, there will be daily Code Wars challenges.

The daily challenge will be posted at 12:00 p.m. every day and will be due by the following day at 8:59 a.m. Plan to focus on this task every day after class sometime between lunch and  p.m. and 2p.m.

### Whiteboarding

Try and rotate your new partner every day for whiteboarding.

Between 12pm and 1:30pm each day, get together with your partner and read through the daily challenge. There are several items to accomplish, as time allows:
  - Read through the challenge and make sure everyone understands what is being asked.
  - Pseudocode your solution on the whiteboard. You can each take turns in this process, or select one person to do all the writing, but each team member **must** participate in the discussion. Pseudocode can be described as writing out your plan in human-readable form. For example, `set up a counter` or `multiply each value by 2`.
  - You should **not** be writing any actual code, only referencing Code Wars for the problem domain.
  - **Take a picture** of your whiteboard pseudocode solution. Make sure each team member has a copy of the picture. This will be included in your personal repo and is part of the individual assignment requirements for full points.
  - You may then continue to work with your partner or part ways to work independently. You should now move on to attempting to write the solution on Code Wars.
  - You'll know your solution is correct when all of the tests pass and turn green. Only then can you add your solution to your repo.
