DS&A, White Boarding and Big O
===

## Learning Objectives

1. Get comfortable writing readable code on a whiteboard
1. Learn how-to whiteboard and "why"
1. Understand differences and uses of arrays and dictionaries (maps)
1. Explain the scaling characteristics (graph shape) and give examples of: 
    * `O(1)`
    * `O(log n)`
    * `O(n)`
    * `O(n^2)`
    * `O(2^n)` 
    * `O(n!)` 
1. Evaluate existing code to determine Big O in time or space


# Agenda

## White Boarding
* Have stations
* Supplies
    * close lid on wipes
    * erasers
    * throw away dead markers
    * let us know if running low
* Exercise:
    * write this function:
    ```
    function greet(greeting, times) {
        const result = '';
        for(let i = 0; i < times; i++) {
            result += greeting;
        }
        return result;
    }
    ```
    * Do it multiple times until instruction staff "signs-off"
    * Must have:
        * legible writing
        * consistent font size
        * level horizontally
        * correct indentation
        * syntactically correct
        * good scale for whiteboard
* Review best practices

## Data Structures: arrays

* Exercise `one`

## Data Structures: objects as dictionaries

* Exercise `two`

## Algorythms

## Big O

[Big O Cheat Sheet](http://bigocheatsheet.com/)

* O(1): random access to an element in a collection, dependent on indexing
* O(n): list iterations
* O(n^2): nested loops on the same collection
* O(log n): divide and conquer
* O(n log n): iterations that use divide and conquer
* O(n!): adding a nested loop for every input you have

* Exercise:
    * (both partners) rewrite findDups to be more efficient `O(n*logn)`
* Demo:
    * `O-n2.js`
    * `O-n-logn.js`
