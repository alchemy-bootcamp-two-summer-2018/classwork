# Bootcamp II ... Code Wars!

Part of growing as a programmer is to practice, practice, practice. Throughout this course, there will be daily Code Wars challenges.

The daily challenge will be posted at 12:00 p.m. every day and will be due by the following day at 8:59 a.m. Plan to focus on this task every day after class sometime between lunch and 2p.m.

## Whiteboarding

Try and rotate your new partner every day for whiteboarding.

Between 12pm and 1:30pm each day, get together with your partner and read through the daily challenge. There are several items to accomplish, as time allows:

* Read through the challenge and make sure everyone understands what is being asked.
* Read through the "tests" in the kata and make sure everyone understands the inputs and outputs
* You can each take turns in the following processes, or select one person to do all the writing, but each team member **must** participate in the discussion.
    * Conceptualize the problem and solution by drawing a picture or diagram. 
    * Pseudocode your solution on the whiteboard. Pseudocode can be described as writing out your plan in human-readable form. For example, `set up a counter` or `multiply each value by 2`.
* You should **not** be writing any actual code, only referencing Code Wars for the problem domain.
* **Take a picture** of your whiteboard pseudocode solution. Make sure each team member has a copy of the picture. This will be included in your assignment requirements for full points.

## Complete the Kata

* You may then continue to work with your partner or part ways to work independently. You should now move on to attempting to write the solution on Code Wars.
* You'll know your solution is correct when all of the tests pass and turn green. Take a screenshot of the submitted solution passing all tests. This will be included in your assignment requirements for full points.
